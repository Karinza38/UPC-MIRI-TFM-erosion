# Simulation of mechanical weathering for modeling rocky terrains
Most terrains used in virtual scenes are based on 2D elevation maps. However, rocky terrains like those found in alpine environments have many detail features like sharp ridges, loose blocks or overhangs that are poorly represented in this maps, so it is common to model them using textures. Instead, in this project, we aim to develop a 3D modeling tool to improve the shape and appearance of rocky scenes using a simplified simulation of mechanical erosion processes, like freeze-thaw weathering.
