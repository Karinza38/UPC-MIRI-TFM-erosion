    This chapter highlights the digital elevation models (DEMs), their generation, grid types, resolution, and interpolation. A DTM is a two-dimensional discrete function of a morphometric variable, which defines the topographic surface as a set of values measured or computed at the grid nodes. Among DTMs are DEMs, digital models of slope gradient, horizontal curvatures, catchment area, and other topographic attributes. DEMs can be generated by various field, remote, and laboratory techniques: conventional topographic surveys, kinematic GPS surveys, analogue, radar techniques, laser surveys, and digitizing of contours. DEMs of stratigraphic surfaces are also compiled using data obtained by various techniques, such as 3D seismic survey, geological boring, and other available geological sources. The selection of a technique to produce a DEM for soil and geological research depends on several factors, such as the size of the study area, required accuracy and resolution of the DEM, accuracy and resolution of other maps and materials as well as the cost of the DEM generation.}

    abstract = {Terrains are a crucial component of three-dimensional scenes and are present in many Computer Graphics applications. Terrain modeling methods focus on capturing landforms in all their intricate detail, including eroded valleys arising from the interplay of varied phenomena, dendritic mountain ranges, and complex river networks. Set against this visual complexity is the need for user control over terrain features, without which designers are unable to adequately express their artistic intent. This article provides an overview of current terrain modeling and authoring techniques, organized according to three categories: procedural modeling, physically-based simulation of erosion and land formation processes, and example-based methods driven by scanned terrain data. We compare and contrast these techniques according to several criteria, speciﬁcally: the variety of achievable landforms; realism from both a perceptual and geomorphological perspective; issues of scale in terms of terrain extent and sampling precision; the different interaction metaphors and attendant forms of user-control, and computation and memory performance. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of possible research directions and outstanding technical and scientiﬁc challenges.},

The DEM contains one additional line in the header information that describes the encoding of the data for any overhanging structures, arches, or caves. This additional data is then appended to the end of the normal DEM ﬁle. We describe a procedural approach to render arches using this modiﬁed DEM. This procedure can thereby generate terrain from ground truth data as opposed to many current methods. The new DEM is backward compatible except for the one additional line in the header; it is also space efﬁcient, needing minimal data necessary for representing the overhanging terrain, thus keeping the ﬁle size at O(n2).},

	abstract = {Fracture simulation can create amazing effects in motion pictures, it is widely used into video games and virtual reality systems. In order to achieve a fast and realistic fracture simulation and in view of the advantages of peridynamics in solving discontinuity problems, we propose a new model, which is based on spring mass model and peridynamics theory, for brittle objects fracture. The method can be described as a two-step strategy. First, the geometric model of an object is preprocessed. The model is completely wrapped in an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box ({AABB}) envelop box, which is subdivided into multiple fragments with 3d Voronoi diagram. The intersection of fragments and the model surface is computed by using the Boolean algorithm, and the fragments outside the model surface are clipped to obtain the final fragments. The Binary Space Partitioning ({BSP}) tree subdivide method is adopted in our preprocessing, which further improves the intersection speed. Second, the fracture is calculated according to spring-mass system based on peridynamics. We view each point as a spring node. The seed points are connected according to the rules of the spring-mass model based on peridynamics to form the spring topology. The object fracture is calculated according to the spring-mass model based on peridynamics. To further improve render quality, normal bump texture mapping is employed to render the fracture surface. Experimental results show that the proposed model provides users with improved visual feedback while the computational cost is at the same magnitude of other similar methods. The proposed method is especially suitable for the simulation of brittle object fracturing.},

In particular, they are characterized by complex underground networks made of varieties of tunnels and breakout chambers with stalagmites and stalactites. Our method computes skeletons of karstic networks by using a gridless anisotropic shortest path algorithm according to ﬁeld data of the underground system (such as inlets and outlets), geomorphological features and parameters such as faults, inception horizons, fractures, and permeability contrasts. From this skeleton, we deﬁne the geometry of the conduits as a signed distance function construction tree combining primitives with blending and warping operators. Our framework provides multiple levels of control, allowing us to author both the structure of the karstic network and the geometric cross-section shapes and details of the generated conduits.},

We explore different architectures for Fully Convolutional Neural Networks to learn upsampling patterns for {DEMs} from detailed training sets (high-resolution {DEMs} and orthophotos), yielding up to one order of magnitude more resolution.

	abstract = {Mountainous digital terrains are an important element of many virtual environments and find application in games, film, simulation and training. Unfortunately, while existing synthesis methods produce locally plausible results they often fail to respect global structure. This is exacerbated by a dearth of automated metrics for assessing terrain properties at a macro level.
            We address these issues by building on techniques from orometry, a field that involves the measurement of mountains and other relief features. First, we construct a sparse metric computed on the peaks and saddles of a mountain range and show that, when used for classification, this is capable of robustly distinguishing between different mountain ranges. Second, we present a synthesis method that takes a coarse elevation map as input and builds a graph of peaks and saddles respecting a given orometric distribution. This is then expanded into a fully continuous elevation function by deriving a consistent river network and shaping the valley slopes. In terms of authoring, users provide various control maps and are also able to edit, reposition, insert and remove terrain features all while retaining the characteristics of a selected mountain range.
            The result is a terrain analysis and synthesis method that considers and incorporates orometric properties, and is, on the basis of our perceptual study, more visually plausible than existing terrain generation methods.},

Although snow-covered terrains have previously received attention in computer graphics, simulating the temporal evolution of glaciers as well as modeling their wide range of features has never been addressed. In this paper, we combine a Shallow Ice Approximation simulation with a procedural amplification process to author high-resolution realistic glaciers. Our multiresolution method allows the interactive simulation of the formation and the evolution of glaciers over hundreds of years. The user can easily modify the environment variables, such as the average temperature or precipitation rate, to control the glacier growth, or directly use brushes to sculpt the ice or bedrock with interactive feedback. Mesoscale and smallscale landforms that are not captured by the glacier simulation, such as crevasses, moraines, seracs, ogives, or icefalls are synthesized using procedural rules inspired by observations in glaciology and according to the physical parameters derived from the simulation. Our method lends itself to seamless integration into production pipelines to decorate reliefs with glaciers and realistic ice features. {CCS} Concepts: • Computing methodologies → Shape modeling.},

	abstract = {Rates and processes of frost weathering in the Alps were investigated by visual observations of intensively shattered rocks, continuous monitoring of frost wedging and rock temperatures in bedrock and measurements of rockfall activity. Rapid frost weathering of hard-intact rocks occurs along lakes and streams where seasonal freezing promotes ice segregation in the rock. Otherwise, rocks require pre-existing weakness or a long exposure period for intensively shattered. Automated monitoring shows that crack opening occurs at three scales, including small opening accompanying short-term frost cycles, slightly larger movements during seasonal freezing and occasional large opening originating from refreezing of snow-melt water during seasonal thawing. The opening events require at least partial water saturation in the crack. The repetition of crack opening (frost wedging) results in permanent opening and finally debris dislocation. Debris collections below fractured rockwalls show that pebble falls occur at an average rate of about 0.1 mm a−1 with significant spatial and inter-annual variations. Occasional large boulder falls significantly raise the rockwall erosion rates, controlled by such factors as the joint distribution in the bedrock, repetition of annual freeze-thaw cycles and extraordinary summer thaw.},

	abstract = {The Discrete Element Method ({DEM}) is increasingly used to simulate the behavior of rock. Despite their intrinsic capability to model fracture initiation and propagation starting from simple interaction laws, classical {DEM} formulations using spherical discrete elements suffer from an intrinsic limitation to properly simulate brittle rock behavior characterized by high values of {UCS}/{TS} ratio associated with non-linear failure envelopes, as observed for hard rock like granite. The present paper shows that the increase of the interaction range between the spherical discrete elements, which increases locally the density of interaction forces (or interparticle bonds), can overcome this limitation. It is argued that this solution represents a way to implicitly take into account the degree of interlocking associated to the microstructural complexity of rock. It is thus shown that increasing the degree of interlocking between the discrete elements which represent the rock medium, in addition to enhancing the {UCS}/{TS} ratio, results in a non-linear failure envelop characteristic of low porous rocks. This approach improves signiﬁcantly the potential and predictive capabilities of the {DEM} for rock modeling purpose. A special emphasis is put on the model ability to capture the fundamental characteristics of brittle rocks in terms of fracture initiation and propagation. The model can reproduce an essential component of brittle rock failure, that is, cohesion weakening and frictional strengthening as a function of rock damage or plastic strain. Based on model predictions, it is ﬁnally discussed that frictional strengthening may be at the origin of the brittle ductile transition occurring at high conﬁning pressures.},

Multiple researchers coming from diﬀerent scientiﬁc disciplines have contributed to the present-day knowledge on the matter and misconceptions still prevail. In a changing climate, the multidisciplinary insights into freeze-thaw action are crucial for a better understanding of rock weathering in natural and anthropogenic environments. In this review, a series of laboratory and in-situ ﬁeld tests are presented to illustrate the present-day methods to assess freeze-thaw weathering. Over the last century, these methods led to insights and the development of theories on damage mechanisms. Presently, it is accepted that crystallization pressure is responsible for the majority of stresses in the material's pores. Damage is induced when these stresses overcome the local tensile strength. Since most of the methods used to derive and validate stress build-up theories are indirect observations of parameters related to the phase transition, it is hard to reach a consensus on the exact explanation for stress development. Direct observations, which require actual real-time observation of the pore space during a freeze-thaw cycle, are therefore favoured to reach agreement. Eventually, the goal is to achieve a better insight on which processes potentially occur, how these vary with diﬀerent environmental, temporal and spatial conditions and under which circumstances damage is inﬂicted.},

Despite {DEM}'s intrinsic capability to capture the mechanical behavior of discontinua, there remains several open questions that include the numerical modelling of the meso-fracture evolution and behavior of brittle rock bodies. A Cohesive Fracture Model ({CFM}) designed explicitly for polyhedral shaped {DEM} particles is proposed for the simulation of the fracture and behavior of brittle rock bodies. A rock body is discretized into a series of rigid polyhedral blocks which are bonded along the boundary faces along the normal and shear directions. A cohesive criterion dictates the normal and shear break strengths of the bonds for the {CFM}. The computational efﬁciency of the {CFM} for polyhedral shaped {DEM} simulations is enhanced by parallelization over multiple graphical processing units ({GPUs}) in the Blaze-{DEM} framework. A series of numerical and laboratory tests are conducted. For marble, these include three-point bending and uniaxial tests to investigate the relationship between the meso-mechanical parameters and macro-mechanical behavior. Following a sensitivity analysis of the meso-mechanical parameters, an inversion procedure is established to estimate the numerical meso-mechanical parameters of the {CFM} model. Two different failure modes for different rocks are proposed.},

We analyze the energy and damage evolution during triaxial compression. The results indicate that the tension and shear-induced cracks increase with the increase of radial stress under the same loading strain rate. Both normal and tangential contact forces exhibit strong anisotropy and increase with radial stress and strain rate. The normal contact force has an approximately symmetrical distribution with respect to the horizontal plane, whereas the tangential contact force has an approximately symmetrical distribution with respect to the axis. For the characteristics of the energy evolution, the boundary energy density, strain energy density, and dissipated energy density all increase linearly with the radial stress, and the boundary energy density increases at the fastest rate, followed by the strain energy density and dissipated energy density. In the post-peak stage the primary energy consumption is the dissipated energy. After that, in the remaining stage the strain energy decreases gradually. By analyzing the evolution of the damage variables in the prepeak area we observed that the damage variable followed an exponential relationship with the axial strain. When the loading strain rate is constant, the damage variable corresponding to the same strain value decreases with increase of radial stress. The results indicate that the increase in radial stress delays the damage acceleration. In contrast, the effect of the loading strain rate on the damage variable is small.

            In order to analyze the influence of meso-structure and meso-parameters on deep granite characteristics, a construction method of variable radius proportional clump model was proposed with particle flow method. The clump particle flow structure was constructed which suited the mechanical characteristics of granite. The deep cavern numerical calculation model of gradual particle density was constructed using the variable radius proportional clump model construction method, and the macroscopic fracture law of deep cavern surrounding rock was analyzed. The results show that meso parameters have lower effects on the compressive and tensile ratios of particle structures in the ball and clump models. It is also found that clump structure is greatly influenced by particle proportion and size while ball model is only slightly influenced by particle size. Furthermore, the compressive and tensile strength curves and fracture modes of numerical simulations and laboratory tests are in good agreement. In addition, the calculated results of the tunnel after simulated excavation are very close to the engineering practice. There are obvious shear failure areas on the right vault and left wall of the tunnel, and the shape and depth of the fracture area are basically the same.},

With the rapid development of computational mechanics, numerical techniques have gradually become robust tools for the investigation of rock fracture. Nevertheless, not all of the devised methods are capable of adequately modelling the rock fracture process. For an accurate simulation of the process, a numerical method needs to be capable of modelling crack initiation, propagation, bifurcation, coalescence and separation. This paper provided a review of recent advances in computational analysis of the rock fracture process, which is built upon a number of literature on numerical modelling of mechanics of failure in rock and other brittle materials. After briefly discussing the fundamentals of rock fracture mechanisms, the basic structure of the existing and recently developed numerical techniques such as finite element method, boundary element method, distinct element method, combined methods and multi-scale coupled method are illustrated. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of these numerical techniques are discussed and the most promising methods are highlighted.},

In the early days of research on terrain scenery representation, a great deal of techniques for representing terrain shapes and rocky textures mainly using noise generation methods such as the midpoint displacement method and {FFT} were reported. In the natural rocky scenery, cracks called "joints" are an important visual feature. After cracking base rocks by joints, the change of the rock shapes according to some factors, such as eliminating rock pieces by weathering or moving by gravity, determines the consequent rocky scenery. In order to create such rocky scenery, in this paper, we propose a rocky scenery modeling method based on joint formation and rock elimination/movement simulation.},

Central to our method is a highly dynamic surface and volume sampling method that supports arbitrary crack initiation, propagation, and termination, while avoiding many of the stability problems of traditional mesh-based techniques. We explicitly model advancing crack fronts and associated fracture surfaces embedded in the simulation volume. When cutting through the material, crack fronts directly affect the coupling between simulation nodes, requiring a dynamic adaptation of the nodal shape functions. We show how local visibility tests and dynamic caching lead to an efﬁcient implementation of these effects based on point collocation. Complex fracture patterns of interacting and branching cracks are handled using a small set of topological operations for splitting, merging, and terminating crack fronts. This allows continuous propagation of cracks with highly detailed fracture surfaces, independent of the spatial resolution of the simulation nodes, and provides effective mechanisms for controlling fracture paths. We demonstrate our method for a wide range of materials, from stiff elastic to highly plastic objects that exhibit brittle and/or ductile fracture.},

We demonstrate that the commonly used stress criteria can lead to arbitrary fracture (especially for stiff materials) and instead propose the notion of a time averaged stress directly into the {FEM} analysis. When objects fracture, the virtual node algorithm provides new triangle and tetrahedral meshes in a straightforward and robust fashion. Although each new rigid body can be rasterized to obtain a new level set, small shards can be difﬁcult to accurately resolve.

	abstract = {Computer-generated erosion and weathering are important to convey setting and mood in computer generated images. Heightmap based landforms are good for distant scenes, but inadequate for scenes containing concave rock formations. Voxel based terrain editing algorithms do admit concave surfaces but do not scale. We introduce weathering on triangulated surface meshes, using a memory efﬁcient modiﬁcation of the Delaunay deformable model. This structure allows the freedom of an unorganized point cloud, the geometric information and visualization of a surface mesh, and the topological freedom of volumetric approaches—all while scaling linearly with surface complexity. We implement both spheroidal weathering and hydraulic erosion algorithms on this structure and demonstrate that the resulting terrain is visually plausible at modest computational cost.},

Our method is mainly composed of two novel parts: (1) a fracture initiation method based on modal analysis, (2) a fast energybased fracture propagation algorithm. We propose a way to compute the contact durations and the contact forces between stiff bodies to simulate the damped deformation wave that is responsible for fracture initiation. As a consequence, our method naturally takes into account the damping properties of the bodies as well as the contact properties to simulate the fracture. To obtain a complete fracture pipeline, we present an efﬁcient way to generate the fragments and their geometric surfaces. These surfaces are sampled on the edges of the physical mesh, to visually represent the actual fracture surface computed. As shown in our results, the computation time performances and realism of our method are well-suited for physically-based interactive applications.},

The common method for fracture simulation in computer games is to pre-fracture models and replace objects by their pre-computed parts at run-time. This popular method is computationally cheap but has the disadvantages that the fracture pattern does not align with the impact location and that the number of hierarchical fracture levels is ﬁxed. Our method allows dynamic fracturing of large objects into an unlimited number of pieces fast enough to be used in computer games. We represent visual meshes by volumetric approximate convex decompositions ({VACD}) and apply user-deﬁned fracture patterns dependent on the impact location. The method supports partial fracturing meaning that fracture patterns can be applied locally at multiple locations of an object. We propose new methods for computing a {VACD}, for approximate convex hull construction and for detecting islands in the convex decomposition after partial destruction in order to determine support structures.},

Morphology changes can be important indicators of an object's make up and the environment in which it exists. Simulating changes in an object's appearance over time has become increasingly popular over the recent years. In this survey we will describe a number of methods used in computer graphics to simulate object morphology changes due natural inﬂuences, such as cracks, fractures, patina, corrosion, erosion, burning, melting, decay, rotting and withering. We will focus on approaches that consider effects which inﬂuence the geometry of the entire object, instead of the surface appearance alone. The methods described are categorised according to the natural phenomena that drive the appearance changes. We pay particular attention to the different object representation and deformation techniques used in current approaches. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the area of object morphology changes driven by the environment.},

Unfortunately, the dominant heightfield representation of terrain precludes such features, and existing in-memory volumetric structures are too memory intensive to handle larger scenes.
            In this article, we present a novel memory-optimized paradigm for representing and generating volumetric terrain based on implicit surfaces. We encode feature shapes and terrain geology using construction trees that arrange and combine implicit primitives. The landform primitives themselves are positioned using Poisson sampling, built using open shape grammars guided by stratified erosion and invasion percolation processes, and, finally, queried during polygonization. Users can also interactively author landforms using high-level modeling tools to create or edit the underlying construction trees, with support for iterative cycles of editing and simulation.
            We demonstrate that our framework is capable of importing existing large-scale heightfield terrains and amplifying them with such diverse structures as slot canyons, sea arches, stratified cliffs, fields of hoodoos, and complex karst cave networks.},

Real-world, tough brittle fractures have dynamic branching behaviour but numerical simulation of this phenomena is notoriously challenging. In order to robustly capture these visual characteristics, we simulate brittle fracture by combining elastodynamic continuum mechanical models with rigid-body methods: A continuum damage mechanics ({CDM}) problem is solved, following rigid-body impact, to simulate crack propagation by tracking a damage field. We combine the result of this elastostatic continuum model with a novel technique to approximate cracks as a non-manifold mid-surface, which enables accurate and robust modelling of material fragment volumes to compliment fast-and-rigid shatter effects. For enhanced realism, we add fracture detail, incorporating
              particle damage-time
              to inform localised perturbation of the crack surface with artistic control. We evaluate our method with numerous examples and comparisons, showing that it produces a breadth of brittle material fracture effects and with low simulation resolution to require much less time compared to fully elastodynamic simulations.},

	abstract = {We continue our development of physically-based models for animating nonrigid objects in simulated physical environments. Our prior work treats the special case of objects that undergo perfectly elastic deformations. Real materials, however, exhibit a rich variety of inelastic phenomena. For instance, objects may restore themselves to their natural shapes slowly, or perhaps only partially upon removal of forces that cause deformation. Moreover, the deformation may depend on the history of applied forces. The present paper proposes inelastically deformable models for use in computer graphics animation. These dynamic models tractably simulate three canonical inelastic behaviors-viscoelasticity, plasticity, and fracture. Viscous and plastic processes within the models evolve a reference component, which describes the natural shape, according to yield and creep relationships that depend on applied force and/or instantaneous deformation. Simple fracture mechanics result from internal processes that introduce local discontinuities as a function of the instantaneous deformations measured through the model. We apply our inelastically deformable modds to achieve novel computer graphics effects.},

This method directly extends our prior work on brittle fracture [O’Brien and Hodgins, {SIGGRAPH} 99].
